In the beginning, there was nothing... only <br>
'Animal crackers in my soup <br>
Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop <br>
Gosh oh gee but I have fun <br>
Swallowing animals one by one <br>
In every bowl of soup I see <br>
Lions and Tigers watching me <br>
I make 'em jump right through a hoop <br>
Those animal crackers in my soup'<br>
</p>
<p> You might be wondering why there are Shirley Temple lyrics in this blog post above, that is the question of the day, dear readers.
<br>Thank you. </p>

<h2>The Dusk of All</h2>

'When their inside me where it's dark <br>
I walk around like Noahs Arc <br>
I stuff my tummy like a goop <br>
With animal crackers in my soup <br>
When their inside me where it's dark <br>
I walk around like Noahs Arc <br>
I stuff my tummy like a goop <br>
With animal crackers in my soup' <br>
</p>
<p>
In the end, there was nothing but Shirley Temple lyrics. I hope you have found the answer to your question.
<br>You're welcome.</p>
